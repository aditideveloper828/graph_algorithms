Graph traversal algorithms as per assignment requirements

The algorithms I have used are:
1. Dijkstra in batteries.py and converters.py
2. BFS in bubbles.py
3. Topological sorting (with DFS) in package.py
4. Prim's algorithm for a minimum spanning tree in snow.py

There is a test() function in each file that contains a few of the test cases used.
